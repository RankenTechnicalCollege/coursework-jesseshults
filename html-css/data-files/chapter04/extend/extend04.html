                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>I discovered that HEX is widely used in web design and that its easy to copy and paste from design tools.
                    almost every site I looked at offered this option. I learned the RGB was designed to help give exact colors that you want on your page design.
                    I learned that the HSL was designed to be human friendly so the user can tweak the colors to their preferred choice.
                </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: My preferred code format is the hsl it seems less to type in, and easier to understand.  </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary: HWB is more human friendly because a user can make simple commands such as "the color is brighter or darker and it will adjust accordingly. 
                    From what I read it's also supposed to be great for themes.
                </p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary: CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key it's used for mainly printing things.
                    It allows perfect control over ink for medias such as magazines.
