            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>

            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>The importance of using descriptive file names for image files is for organization and searchability of the files.
                If the image is consistent it can help all coders on the program have uniformity.
            </p>

            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Paint to change the image size.</p>

            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was a width of 2121 and a height of 1414.</p>

            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
          <img src="html5.jpg" alt="Hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="2121" width="1414"



            <p>The online compressor I used to reduce the image file size was "compressor.io". The original file size for this image was 883k after compression the new file size is 45kb.  </p>

            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
           <img src="html5_min.jpg" alt="Hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="2121" width="1414"

           > <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
