    <p>I am using Visual Studio Code as my text editor to complete this assignment.</p>

    <p> Chapter 1 provides an overview of webpage design and all of the design elements that must be taken into consideration when creating a webpage. Before you begin coding a website, you must first create a wireframe and site map. Next, you need to consider several design elements, such as graphics, navigation, and color. finally, ou must also plan for accessability.</p>

    <p>What I learned in this chapter is that every key-stroke must be methodical and that there is a lot more behind the scenes in creating a webpage. I hope to be able to grasp the technics to do well at what I am learning.</p>
