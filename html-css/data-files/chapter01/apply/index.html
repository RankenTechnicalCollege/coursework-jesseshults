     <p>I am using Visual Studio Code as my text editor to complete this assignment.<p>

     
    </p>To plan a website, first define its purpose and goals and identify your target audience. Next, develop a sitemap and content strategy, then choose a domain name and hosting provider. Plan the user experience (UX), including design, branding, and user journey. Finally, create compelling content, build the site, and develop a plan for testing and launch. <p>

 </p> What I learned in chapter one is that there is a lot more behind the scene to creating web pages than I initially believed there to be. I understand the learning curve I face to understand this coursework. I learned that you have to specify the language you wish to you for each website you design and every key stroke has to be methodical.</p>
