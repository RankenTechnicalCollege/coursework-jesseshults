        <p> prices  can range anywhere between &#36;75 and &#36;150 per hour</p>

        <p>I searched groomers in my area as the book suggested and almost every link I clicked on took me to facebook so each one has the same kind of layout, I would create my own website to stand apart from the other sites to show my professionalism. </p>
