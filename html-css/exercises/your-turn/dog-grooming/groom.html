        <p>Prices can range anywhere between &#36;75 and &#36;150 per hour.</p>

        <p>I searched groomers in my area as the book suggested and almost every link I clicked on took me to Facebook. Each one had the same kind of layout. I would create my own website to stand apart from the others and show my professionalism.</p>
